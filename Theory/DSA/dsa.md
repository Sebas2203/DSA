<h2>What are Data Structure?</h2>

Is a way to store data.

<h2>What are Algorithms?</h2>

Is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem or archive a specific goal.

When exploring algorithms, we ofthen look at how much time an algorithm takes to run realtive size of the data set. Each algorithm has [**_time complexity_**](../Time%20Complexity/timeComplexity.md)

# Fist Step

<h2> Create your first algorithm!</h2>

[Fibonacci Numbers](./FibonacciNumbers.js) is the algorithm that you always sum of the two previous numbers, por example; 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21...

Let's check differents ways to implement solutions to find [Fibonacci Numbers](./FibonacciNumbers.js):

- Using a **Loop**
- Using **Recursion**
- Finding the ***n*th**, using **Recursion**
