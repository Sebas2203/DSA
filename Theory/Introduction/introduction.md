<h2> Create your first algorithm!</h2>

[Fibonacci Numbers](./FibonacciNumbers.js) is the algorithm that you always sum of the two previous numbers, por example; 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21...

Let's check differents ways to implement solutions to find [Fibonacci Numbers](./FibonacciNumbers.js):

- Using a **Loop**
- Using **Recursion**
- Finding the ***n*th**, using **Recursion**
