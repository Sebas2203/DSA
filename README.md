# DSA

**Data Structures and Algorithms** (DSA) are essential in programming because the provide the foundation for writing efficient and optimized code. They gelp developers solve problems effectively by organizing and processing data in the best possible way. Understanding DSA allows programmers to choose the right tools to handle tasks like searching, sorting and managing data, which is especially important when working with large systems or real-time applications. Additionally, DSA is a major focus in technical interviews at top tech companies, making a critical skill for career advancement. Beyond job preparation, mastering DSA also build strong logical thinking and prepares developers for more advanced topics in computer science such as database, machine learing and system desing.
